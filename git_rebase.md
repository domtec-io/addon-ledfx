The message you're seeing indicates that Git is asking you to define how to handle divergences between your local and remote branches when you perform a `git pull`. This situation typically occurs when there are commits on your local branch that aren't on the remote branch, and vice versa. Git is essentially asking you to choose a strategy for integrating these changes.

Here are the options Git is suggesting:

1. **Merge (git config pull.rebase false)**: This option will merge changes from the remote branch to your local branch when you pull. It preserves the chronological order of commits and will create a merge commit if there are changes in both local and remote branches that need to be combined.

2. **Rebase (git config pull.rebase true)**: This option will reapply your local changes on top of what is on the remote branch. This can make the project history cleaner, as it will appear as if your changes were made after all the changes in the remote branch, potentially avoiding a merge commit.

3. **Fast-forward only (git config pull.ff only)**: This option will only update your branch when the changes in the remote branch can be fast-forwarded to your branch, meaning it will only apply if your local commits do not diverge from the remote's history.

### Setting Your Preference

You can set your preference in two ways:
- **Locally for just this repository**: Without using `--global`, your setting applies only to the current repository.
- **Globally for all your repositories**: By adding `--global`, you set the default behavior for all repositories you work on with your Git configuration.

### Examples

If you prefer merging, you would set it like this:
```bash
git config pull.rebase false  # Locally
git config --global pull.rebase false  # Globally
```

For rebasing, use:
```bash
git config pull.rebase true  # Locally
git config --global pull.rebase true  # Globally
```

For fast-forward only:
```bash
git config pull.ff only  # Locally
git config --global pull.ff only  # Globally
```

### Applying Configurations

Once you have set your preference, Git will no longer show this message and will handle pulls according to your configuration. If you encounter any issues or need to switch strategies later, you can change the setting using the same commands.
